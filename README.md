# EasyAI - Extremely Easy AI for Learning and Deploying

**One folder for one model, one file for inference, one file for model structure and one for readme.**  

EasyAI strives to streamline prominent AI model repositories on GitHub by eliminating unnecessary files from the original repositories. We retain only essential components, including the model structure definition file, the model inference script, and a README file. This approach ensures simplicity and clarity, making it easy for beginners to comprehend and learn, while also providing developers with a straightforward deployment process.
